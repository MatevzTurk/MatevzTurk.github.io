I'm a first year PhD student in the Theoretical Materials Chemistry group at Uppsala University.

My fields of interest span from theoretical and computational chemistry to experimental physical chemistry and organic synthesis

I'm currently working on modelling ion diffusion in solid-state electrolyte materials.









Homepage is currently work in progress...

To Do List:
======

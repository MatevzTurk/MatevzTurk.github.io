I'm a first year PhD student in the Theoretical Materials Chemistry group at Uppsala University.

My fields of interest span from theoretical and computational chemistry to experimental physical chemistry and organic synthesis.

I'm currently working on modelling ion diffusion in solid-state electrolyte materials.

Fields of Research
======
I believe in building a comprehensive understanding of chemistry, and I enjoy exploring diverse areas. My experience spans:

- **Software development for chemical simulations** 💻  
- **Experimental physical chemistry** ⚗️
- **Organic synthesis** 🧪
- **Teaching** 🧑‍🏫

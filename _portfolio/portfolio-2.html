This project investigates the interactions between polyelectrolytes and oppositely charged surfactants, focusing on the role of hydrophobic interactions. We study sodium poly(styrenesulfonate) (NaPSS) in combination with either a conventional hydrocarbon surfactant, dodecylpyridinium chloride (DPC), or a fluorinated surfactant, 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecylpyridinium chloride (HFDePC).

Our goal is to understand how surfactant structure and hydrophobicity influence binding behavior, aggregation, and phase properties in both linear NaPSS solutions and cross-linked NaPSS hydrogels.
